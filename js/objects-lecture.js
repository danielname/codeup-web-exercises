//methods and properties represent strings, numbers, etc as objects and identify the property

// currentWeather is a reference to the object, which is not the same as the name of a variable.
// in variables the bits represented by the var are stored in the var, but in objects they are not stored in the same place
// each pair in an object is a property that has key: variable

// an object that has a function as a variable is the foundations for a method.
